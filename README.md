## Classification Challenge

- This project compares the Logistic Regression model and the Random Forest Classifier model in accuracy of fitting, modelling, and predicting text data is considered 'spam' or not based on features such as specific word frequencies (ex: 'our'), specific character frequencies (ex: '$'), and length of capital runs.
- The data set's features are scaled using StandardScaler().
